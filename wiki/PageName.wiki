# Story backlog - Listing of items to complete

= Introduction =

Here is a listing of items to complete in a prioritized listing.  Thus, stories on the top which are incomplete should be taken on first before stories on the bottom.  Stories here are marked as complete when they are implemented, tested, and evaluated by someone that has not written the code (in place of paired programming).

This process can change as time goes on.

= Backlog =

* Paint world map
* Paint character (PC)
* Keys can be used to navigate the character
