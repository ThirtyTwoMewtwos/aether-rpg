= Introduction =

Here is a listing of items to complete in a prioritized listing.  Thus, stories on the top which are incomplete should be taken on first before stories on the bottom.  Stories here are marked as complete when they are implemented, tested, and evaluated by someone that has not written the code (in place of paired programming).

This process can change as time goes on.

== Backlog ==

  * Equipment View: The view should show a left and right hand, a head, feet, legs, torso, and arms and the items in which are placed on the character.  Thus, the picture of a left hand could show a sword laying over top.  For now, we will not show a fully body displaying the different items being carried, and instead focus on the equipment and the equipment place-ability. - _im.a.hypocrite, Captain.queezy_
