= UI Layout and Controls =

 * Player HUD system.  This is a display located in the north-west corner of the screen that displays the player's class symbol such as a sword and shield for a Holy Knight, the players hit points in a bar form (bar is red), and the players magic points also displayed in bar form (bar is blue).

 * Player skill bar(s).  This is a bar containing slots to assign skills/abilities to a location in the bar.  This bar will contain 12 slots per bar.  Each bar will be given a keyboard shortcut {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,-,=} for the default bar and then shift + the shortcut set, lastly followed by crtl + the shortcut set. Any additional bars will have no keyboard shortcuts.  Alternatively, you can mouse click a skill in a bar to activate that skill (if the skill is applicable to be used). The mouse click is the only way to activate skills on bars more than 3 (the ones with no shortcuts).

* Window Buttons.  These are clickable buttons that produce various windows to aid users.  The available buttons (explaned in the windows section in more detail) will be:  Options, Persona, Skills/Abilities, Inventory, Slaves, Map, Camp, Social, Quests.  These buttons will be toggle buttons and textured with only an icon.  These windows might have successor windows.  Each of the 9 parent windows will have a keyboard shortcut { options = esc; persona = p; skills = k; inventory = i; slaves = l (L); map = m; camp = c; social = o; quests = j;}

* Mini-map.  Spherical radius of player using standard colored dots to represent a top-down view of immediate surroundings.
