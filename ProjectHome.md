Ã†ther is a level-based role playing game built in the Java programming language. Levels are achieved through Player vs. Environment (PvE) skill-based combat and completing quests in the world.

Graphics are based on the Java Monkey Engine (jME) and GBui component interaction framework built on top of Bui (Banana User Interface).

Players can select a class based on alignment of Revenants(Evil) and Humans(Good).

Each class holds a role to be helpful in a group while still allowing progressive single play.
