*UI Structure*
I was stepping through trying to write up a clean way to test the UI, but I think that the logic and the UI is too much together.  I was thinking that we can separate out the presentation from the logic by creating 2 classes instead of 1.  We can use the MVP pattern (or what Martin Fowler calls [http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PassiveScreen.html Passive View]) and make the Presentation talk to a presenter class, which in turn will talk to/manipulate the model.  This will allow us to test thoroughly the logic, and later we can identify a tool to test the UI (which there are many for Swing).
